# Deep Learning Neural Network
A feed forward deep learning neural network that is trained with gradient descent to recognize handwritten digits (training data provided by MNIST)

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to learn the inner workings of modern machine learning and the techniques used. More specifically, my goal is to implement a feed forward neural network that can be used to recognize handwritten digits.

## Introduction
The fundamental principles behind a deep learning neural network is to mimic the mechanisms in a brain, where individual neurons are connected with each other to form a network of neurons. The output of such network can be described with how much each individual neuron becomes excited based on the strength of connections to each stimulus. This behaviour can be modeled mathematically with a discrete map:

To calculate how much each neuron is stimulated, each input is simply multiplied with the corresponding
